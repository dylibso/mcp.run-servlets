I'll help you search for funny cartoon Santa pictures using Brave Search.

I found several funny cartoon Santa images! Here are a few highlights:

A skating Santa Claus doing some winter sports - he's shown gliding along with a big smile
A cheerful running Santa that looks quite energetic
A cute Santa character with an especially jolly expression
A set of different Santa poses showing him in various funny situations
Since these are mostly stock images, I could try to draw you a simple cartoon Santa using SVG if you'd like! I can make something simple and fun. Would you like me to try that instead?
</blockquote>

please fetch one of those pictures for me!

There's the skating Santa! It shows him doing an elegant skating pose against a nighttime city backdrop, with his arms raised joyfully. The cartoon style is modern and cute, with a simple color palette of red, white, and dark blue. Would you like to see any of the other Santa images as well?
