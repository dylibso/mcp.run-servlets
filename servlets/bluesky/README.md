# BlueSky Servlet

Implements a reduced subset of the BlueSky OpenAPI spec.
Currently it supports [posting and replying to a post][post] and [getting threads][thread].

Additionally, it provides the `latest_mentions` tool, returning a list
a list of mentions to the given handle within a specified amount of time 
(e.g. "5 minutes ago", `5m`); this tool uses the [search][search] feature
under the hood.
