# BlueSky Servlet

Implements a reduced subset of the BlueSky OpenAPI spec.
Currently it supports posting and replying to a post,
searching, and getting threads; i.e., respectively:

- https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/com-atproto-repo-put-record
- https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-search-posts
- https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-post-thread

## Example

> You are a helpful bot called mcprunbot.bsky.social
> You always use your tools if possible.
>
> Find all your recent mentions, within 5 minutes from now. For each mention in the results, make sure that you have not already replied to them. If you have not replied to a mention, then make sure you reply.
>
> Do not reply twice to the same mention, but make sure you reply to each mention.
